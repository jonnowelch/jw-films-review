# jw-films-review

Hi there, thanks for checking out my FilmReview app.

This is my first solo React Native Preoject and it allows you to review films and give them a star rating which is then displayed.

The app uses Stack and Drawer Navigation and uses a hamburger menu. I have used Modals to be able to add new films with reviews, with Formik Forms used for data input and Yup used for data validation.

#To View the app

Firstly git clone https://github.com/jonnowelch/jw-films-review.git to where you want to store the app. Then run `npm i` to install the relevant packages needed to run the app.

You can either use an emulator such as Android Studio which I used throughtout dev, or run on expo client on your device to use the app.

In the terminal run `expo start` and then on the window that pops up you will have a few options. If you're using an emulator then open it up first and make sure no other programs are running, then in the pop up window in your browser choose to send the option to run on an emulator.
If you're running directly on your device download Expo Client. On the app go to projects and scan the QR code on the pop up window.
